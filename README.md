# rsaChatServer
A Horribly insecure RSA chat server and client

This was just something I rushed together for a systems programming class, so
it's really just a "hey look, I can implement RSA" thing.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.X

**How to run**

Get parameters from either `server.py -h` or `client.py -h`.
